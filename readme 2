Here is a step-by-step approach to transitioning from lexicon-based detection to AI-powered surveillance for long email texts with lexicon terms occurring in the middle:

### Step 1: Data Preparation and Labeling
- **Extract Emails and Segment:** Extract your long email texts from your communication systems. Segment them into manageable chunks if needed (e.g., sentences or paragraphs).
- **Label Data:** Use your existing lexicon tool to label which emails or chunks contain market abuse indicators. Also, manually label a subset to create a high-quality ground truth dataset.
- **Identify Key Lexicon Occurrences:** Mark where in the email the lexicons appear for downstream explainability.

### Step 2: Baseline Model with Lexicon Alerts
- **Run Lexicon Matching:** Continue running your current lexicon pattern matching on the entire email text to detect potential abuse.
- **Record Lexicon Positions:** Store the positions of lexicon hits within each email or segment.

### Step 3: Feature Engineering with Contextual Embeddings
- **Get Text Embeddings:** Use transformer-based language models pre-trained on finance or general domains (e.g., FinBERT) to generate contextual embeddings for the full email or segments.
- **Incorporate Lexicon Indicators:** Add features indicating lexicon presence and location to the embeddings, allowing the model to combine semantic context with lexicon signals.

### Step 4: Train a Hybrid AI Model
- **Model Design:** Train a classifier (e.g., fine-tuned FinBERT with added lexical feature inputs) using labeled data to differentiate abusive from non-abusive communications.
- **Consider Sequence Modeling:** Since lexicons appear within long text, use models capable of handling long sequences or hierarchical models that combine sentence-level and document-level understanding.
- **Leverage Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Extract named financial entities and events for additional context.

### Step 5: Implement Explainable AI Techniques
- **Highlight Lexicon Influence:** Use SHAP or LIME to explain model decisions, showing how both lexicons and contextual features contributed to alerts.
- **Visualize Important Text:** Provide compliance analysts with highlighted parts of emails that triggered flags, focusing especially on lexicon hits and surrounding context.

### Step 6: Deploy Phased AI-Powered Alerting
- **Alert Triage:** Initially, use AI only to re-rank or triage lexicon-generated alerts based on confidence scores.
- **Analyst Review:** Gather feedback from compliance teams on alert relevance to retrain the model iteratively.

### Step 7: Expand Model Scope Beyond Lexicons
- **Detect Novel Patterns:** Use few-shot or active learning to incorporate new abuse patterns and language variations that lexicons miss.
- **Continuous Learning:** Create pipelines for ongoing labeling and model refinement as new data arrives.

### Step 8: Monitor, Audit, and Improve
- **Impact Monitoring:** Track false positives, false negatives, and analyst workload reductions.
- **Regular Retraining:** Periodically retrain models with newly labeled data to adapt to evolving communication styles and abuse tactics.
- **Compliance Audits:** Maintain explainability documentation for regulators, showing how lexicons and AI jointly enforce surveillance.

This approach combines the strengths of lexicon-based precision with AIâ€™s contextual understanding, especially suited for long email texts where abuse indicators may be buried within extensive content. It maintains explainability and regulatory trust while reducing manual effort over time.
